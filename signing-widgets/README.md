# Generating Signature for Widgets

Learn how to create signatures that can secure the upload process in the Upload and Media Library Widgets.  You'll creates APIs to work with Front end apps and serve the widgets with signatures statically.

There's a bonus server app that shows you how you can get a server to create signed URLs for you.

## Running the Code

You will need to `cd` into the `bonu` and `server` directories to `npm install` the libraries needed and start the servers.

You start the servers by executing

```bash
node app.js
```
